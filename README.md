##Game Description:
Guess a number is a simple guessing game. Each game begins with a random 'target'
number between the minimum and maximum values provided, and a maximum number of
'attempts'. 'Guesses' are sent to the `make_move` endpoint which will reply
with either: 'too low', 'too high', 'you win', or 'game over' (if the maximum
number of attempts is reached).
Many different Guess a Number games can be played by many different Users at any
given time. Each game can be retrieved or played by using the path parameter
`urlsafe_game_key`.
